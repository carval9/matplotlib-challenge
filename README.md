Observations after analysing the data

1) Capomulin and Ramicane have the smaller average tumor volume
2) The number of male and female mices are almost the same. With the data we can see that 51% are male and 49% are female
3) The tumor volume for one mouse using Capomulin decreases over time
4) There are more timepoints for mice in Capomulin and Ketapril regimes
